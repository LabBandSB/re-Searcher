re-Searcher is a toolbox aimed to simplify the task for genomics data mining from VCF files. Now there's no need to perform difficult script manipulations in IDE with Python or R. re-Searcher can work with any variant of VCF, for instance, with annotated VCF in ANNOVAR.

## Quick Start
Installation of application or script execution are not needed. User simply should run re-searcher.exe

## Features
1.	Browse and open VCF files

2.	Extract header from VCF to new VCF 

3.	Extract lines containing user input keywords from the input entry or from a Text Document file. Then, can be saved to new VCF.

4.	Extract user input samples from the input entry or from a Text Document file. Unnecessary samples from original VCF will be cut off and only user input samples will be remained. Then, can be saved to new VCF.

5.	Convert Genotype (GT) format from number GT to letter GT. 
Original GT format is numeric (0/0, 0/1, 1/0 or 1/1), whereas 0 is reference (REF) allele and 1 is alternative (ALT) allele. If REF or ALT is more than one nucleotide, they will not be converted into letter GT format.

## Usage
●	To open VCF file for mining, click the ‘Browse’ button:

●	To get header from VCF, click ‘Extract Header’ button:

Program will ask you where to save an output file with Header. 

●	To search and extract lines with certain user input keywords, firstly, input your keywords in ‘Keywords’ entry, and then press ‘Extract’ button.

●	 In cases when there are too many keywords, it is inconvenient to input them manually. Create Text Document and copy all necessary keywords in one column.

Then, press ‘Extract from File’ button, after which program ask you to open the Text Document with keywords that you had created.

●	To search and extract user input samples (rows), firstly, input your keywords in ‘Sample’ entry, and then press ‘Extract’ button. Program will cut off unnecessary samples.

●	 Similarly as multiple keywords search from a file, you can input a file with samples. Create Text Document and copy all necessary samples in one column.

Then, press ‘Extract from File’ button, after which program ask you to open the Text Document with keywords that you had created.

●	To convert the numeric GT format to letter GT format press ‘Convert GT’ button.
